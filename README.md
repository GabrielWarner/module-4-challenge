#Gabriel-Warner-Module4-Challenge
In this assignment I used my new knowledge of javascript and used it to manipulate the DOM. I used function with event listeners in order to get the game running and have certain elements dissapear when you click on a button and have other elements appear on your screen. I was very confident when it came to the HTML and CSS but when it came to the javascript is where I struggled. After I psuedo code my biggest problem is not know where to get started. I know what I need to do but I dont know what order and when to make certain functions. I worked with my tutor Matthew Calimbas and he helped me on getting the questions to appear when the user clicks start. After that I managed to get the timer, local storage and the score logic down and coded. For the most part I think I did pretty well on this assignement. Overall I need to work on my problem solving skills when it comes to putting the pieces together to deploy my application.
